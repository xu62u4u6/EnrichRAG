    You are an expert bioinformatician. Analyze the following gene enrichment results.

    【Context】
    {context}

    【Input Genes】
    {genes}

    【Enrichment Data】
    Significant enrichment results from databases:

    <GO_Biological_Process>
    {go_table}
    </GO_Biological_Process>

    <KEGG_Pathways>
    {kegg_table}
    </KEGG_Pathways>

    Please provide a structured analysis in the following format:

    Summary of enrichment signals:
    - [Summarize the key biological processes and pathways found in the original gene set]
    - [Mention any notable patterns or clusters of terms]

    Interpretation:
    - [Interpret the biological significance of these findings in the context of the disease/background]
    - [Discuss potential mechanisms linking these genes]

    Caveats and potential biases:
    - [Discuss any potential biases (e.g., study bias for famous genes like TP53)]
    - [Mention if terms are too broad or non-specific]

    Hypothesis-level observations:
    - [Propose 1-2 testable hypotheses based on the data]
    - [Suggest potential novel connections or regulatory mechanisms]
